Content-Freeze
==============

This repository is to assist in the management of assets during the great Matrix CMS content freeze of 2014.

Top level files or folders should be named with the name of the root node and the asset ID. eg. "VC email 98383"
If it's a simple change, then just a text file, if it involves binaries, make a folder.

Make a note of everything, no matter how small, event if the changes don't need to be migrated when the new system goes live.
